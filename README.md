The python code uses NLP to train a Text CNN model in order to categorize news based on their headlines and a short description of the contents. For the NLP we used the GloVe embedding to construct our embedding matrix.

We further improve our model using a bidirectional GRU. The improvement shows up in an increase of validation accuracy from 58.15% to 63.77%.
